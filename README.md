# Programmable-Embroidered-Biopotential-Electrodes-with-Motion-Artifact-Removal


This research work presents the development of flexible and wearable dry electrodes for EMG signal monitoring.

The proposed Python tool generates machine files with extensions (.exp) and (.dst), which are compatible with embroidery machines from Janome, Brother, and Bernina for textile fabrications.

All parameters are adjustable and controllable, including electrode dimensions, stitch patterns, and filling areas of electrodes. The provided machine code will create stitch patterns on cloth by using the embroidery machine that is compatible with .dst and .exp files.

In this work, we are providing the .dst and .exp files as open source on GitHub so that everyone can access and use these dry electrodes for their research work. This open-source initiative aims to foster collaboration and innovation among researchers by allowing them to modify, enhance, and apply the designs in various contexts.
